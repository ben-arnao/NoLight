Please add the following files to the chat so I can determine whether your Unity project already has a build script (and, if needed, which files would need editing). Only these files are the most likely places for a build script or CI workflow:

- Assets/Editor/BuildScript.cs
- Assets/Editor/BuildPlayer.cs
- BuildScripts/Build.cs
- Tools/Build/Build.cs
- build.bat
- build.ps1
- build.sh
- .github/workflows/unity-ci.yml
- .gitlab-ci.yml
- azure-pipelines.yml
- .circleci/config.yml
- package.json

If you don't have any of those files, tell me and I will propose where to add a build script (Editor/Build or a CI workflow). Once you add the files you want me to inspect, I'll check them and tell you whether a build script exists and what to change.
